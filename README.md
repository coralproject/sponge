# Sponge

[Sponge](https://github.com/coralproject/sponge) is Coral's data import layer. It is an Extract, Transform, and Load command line tool designed to:

* Read data from a foreign source,
* Translate the schema into Coral conventions, and
* POST entities to our service layer for insertion.

All of the [Sponge documentation](http://coral-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sponge/) (including [installation instructions](http://coral-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sponge/install/)) can be found in the [Coral Project Documentation](http://coral-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The Sponge documentation [lives in Github](https://github.com/coralproject/docs/tree/master/sponge) in the "coralproject/docs/sponge" repository.
