# Sponge

[Sponge](https://github.com/coralproject/sponge) is Coral's data import layer. It is an Extract, Transform, and Load command line tool designed to:

* Read data from a foreign source,
* Translate the schema into Coral conventions, and
* POST entities to our service layer for insertion.

All of the [Sponge documentation](https://coralprojectdocs.herokuapp.com/sponge/) (including installation instructions) can be found in the [Coral Project Documentation](https://coralprojectdocs.herokuapp.com/).

The Sponge documentation [lives in Github](https://github.com/coralproject/docs/tree/master/docs_dir/sponge) in the `coralproject/docs/docs_dir/sponge` repository.
