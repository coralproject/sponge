# Sponge

Get your existing community to Coral. This is a command line tool to import comments, authors, assets and other entities into the coral system.

## Overview

Sponge is Coral's Data Import Layer.  It is designed to read data from a foreign _source_, translate the schema into coral conventions, and POST entities to [our service layer](https://github.com/coralproject/pillar) for inserting.

Where to get the data and how to translate it is expressed through _strategies_.

## Install

Read the [INSTALL file](https://github.com/coralproject/sponge/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md)
