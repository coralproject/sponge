## What I'm working on (Gaba)

Today


. CHANGE STRUCTURE FOR JSON STRATEGY 
. MYSQL IS NOT YET WORKING WITH NEW STRATEGY

get all the transforms into one place (now that the strucutre is more flexible)



STRATEGY FILE HAS TO HAVE A VALIDATION OF THE CONFIGURATION FILE (AS IN THE SCHEMA, WHAT IS REQUIRED)

* convert config into Strategy
** logs

* transformations
  ** look to convert it into map[string][interface]
* tests - how to better do themselves


This days:
* add benchmark functions for pulling from mysql and adding to mongodb
