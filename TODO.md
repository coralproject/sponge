## What I'm working on (Gaba)

Today

* tests
* go to finish service layer endpoints and use them ehre

This days:
* add benchmark functions for pulling from mysql and adding to mongodb
* Move from Scan to prepare stmt


FUTURE
* logging

Questions GO lang

* TESTS - how to better do themselves
* Configuration, review that code
* Model is the interface for all the model structs <--- be carefull, this is an interface that Comment, Asset and Note are implementing. Transform is acting on a slice of Model (how that works?)
* Vendoring: we are not doing it
