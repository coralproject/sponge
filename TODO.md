## What I'm working on (Log)

On the day:
* get the configuration everywhere (mongodb.go has hardcoded configuration)
* mongodb is giving an error!
* be able to add more than one table from the strategy
* YAML

This days:
* add benchmark functions for pulling from mysql and adding to mongodb
* Add TESTS


FUTURE
* Move from Scan to prepare stmt
* Divide importing in phases (by LIMIT)
* Look at concurrency for importing?
* Get Strategy's configuration for this phase 1 (tier 1)
* logging
* error system
