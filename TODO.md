## What I'm working on (Gaba)

Today


STRATEGY FILE HAS TO HAVE A VALIDATION OF THE CONFIGURATION FILE (AS IN THE SCHEMA, WHAT IS REQUIRED)

* convert config into Strategy
** logs
** pointers!!

* transformations
  ** look to conver it into map[string][interface]
* tests - how to better do themselves


This days:
* add benchmark functions for pulling from mysql and adding to mongodb
