## What I'm working on (Gaba)

* Adds more tables

This days:
* add benchmark functions for pulling from mysql and adding to mongodb
* Add TESTS
* YAML
* Move from Scan to prepare stmt


FUTURE
* Divide importing in phases (by LIMIT)
* Look at concurrency for importing?
* Get Strategy's configuration for this phase 1 (tier 1)
* logging
* error system
